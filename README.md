# hash_pass
Hashing code literally stolen from the README of https://github.com/stepchowfun/hashpass. This is a CLI version of HashPass and
generates the same hashes as the HashPass Chrome Extension. 

## Notes
- I recomend making adding this script to your PATH or /bin/ folder so you can easily access it
- HashPass can copy to your clipboard automatically with 'xclip'. Make sure your have it.
- You can save your mater password and domains to a file in $HOME/.config/hashpass
