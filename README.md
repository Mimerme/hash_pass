# hash_pass
Code literally stolen from the README of https://github.com/stepchowfun/hashpass. CLI version of HashPass and
generates the same hashes as the HashPass Chrome Extension. 

## Notes
- I recomend making adding this script to your PATH or /bin/ folder so you can easily access it
- Create a file named 'key' with your master password in plaintext if you don't want to keep typing it in
- HashPass also copies to your clipboard automatically with 'xclip'. Make sure your have it.
